A cinematic landmark. It is marred only by the fact that the plotting is a bore. The novel is an intricate world with multiple conflicts and story threads. But this movie doesn't translate those characters and conflicts into a dramatic story. Some say Paul is the chosen one, some say he's not   - -he gets put through the wringer,  and then guess what? That's the film in a nutshell though a spoiler wouldn't ruin anything for you because you need to see this film and experience it for the genius and craft of a master filmmaker.","1"

They are both decent movies, but I feel they try too hard to appease those who read the book. To no avail I might add. They go into too much minute detail that feels better suited for a directors cut. These precious minutes could of kept the flow much smoother and more palatable for the average audience. Personally I don't like the visuals entirely because there's not enough color. I think it's deliberate to highlight the eyes but it's a detail that makes all the good work done seem a little more drab. All that said there is enough story progression and new information to keep the saga entraining. Though the obvious savior complex going on is soooo annoying.","1"

They significantly changes out major characters for no reason and dumbed down the freman.

Paul's character development and the significant change he undergoes in this film deserve recognition. Unlike Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin/Vader, Timothee's performance doesn't fall into the trap of making Paul seem like a spoiled kid. The visuals and locations are top-notch with stunning scenery throughout the movie. While the plot may not be the most intricate and you might have a sense of where it's headed, the film still keeps you hooked until the end, offering a fresh and engaging experience. Personally, I feel that the Harkonnen cousins (sorry, their names escape me) deserved more screen time or at least more memorable deaths, given the praise they received from fans and media. Overall, both Dune movies together make for a fantastic viewing session, although they might not reach epic status or be remembered for years to come. But if you're considering watching them, I say go for it—both movies are definitely worth it for their captivating visuals alone.","1"

Chani would have NEVER left Paul. Not even considered it.
In fact, it was Chani's idea that she and Paul not marry, in case he needed to marry the Princess, which he did.
But it was Chani that bore his children. It was Chani that loved and supported him through it all.

And why the hell is Alia still in the womb? She should've been around the age of 4-6 by the time Fayd and Paul went head to head.

Chani is one of the biggest let downs for me in this movie. In the books she loved Paul and supported him in everything. She might not have liked it but she never walked away from Paul. She was one of his biggest supporters. They talked about never getting married so he could marry the princess and rule the empire. Just like in the first movie, so much of the story is changed to fit something that doesn't resemble the source material. It isn't a horrible movie if you know nothing of the source material. But if you like adaptations to respect the source material this movie falls short.","1"

Visually speaking, the movie is just gorgeus and you can't take your eyes off the screen.

The action scenes were also nice, although i wish it had more of them, or at least more variety; maybe upon second vieweing my opinion will change, but they seemed a bit repetitive. That's just a very minor complaint tho. It is understandable that there is a story to tell and only so much you can do in a desert, action wise.

It is also annoying that it ends on another kind of cliffhanger, but in a franchise like this, that is perhaps more suited for a tv series, it's impossible not to end in one. 
The fact that Dennis Villeneuve managed - with a limited near 3 hour runtime - to insert so much lore, characters, and deliver on the action, in a way that both Dune fans and newcomers feel happy, is an incredible accomplishment.

Synopsis

After the events of the first part that occurred on the planet Arrakis, the young Paul Atreides joins the Fremen tribe and begins a spiritual and martial journey to become a messiah, while trying to avoid the horrible, but inevitable future that he has witnessed: a Holy War in his name, which spans the entire known universe .

When Dune was released in 2021, the impossible seemed to have been achieved with the tremendous adaptation that the Canadian director achieved, but only he could surpass himself and improve his first film to give us an even bigger and even more epic spectacle in his amazing sequel. This author's blockbuster is once again present, giving us a truly satisfactory film that is positioned right among the best of 2024, without any doubt about that.

Denis Villeneuve knows how to make everything more intense in this second installment and know how to give us a tour of intense moments, somewhat complex and highly dialogued, but that captivate you as everything happens thanks to the fact that the director knows how to captivate you with the music, the photography, the desert and its characters that develop a personality with which you are part of the entire ascent until the masterful final climax with which the director breaks all the schemes and demonstrates the greatness that his masterpiece represents. It may have a few defects, because the truth is it does, but they are insignificant compared to the final result of a complex work to be adapted, but which Denis Villeneuve makes seem so simple once projected on the screen and that is clearly the greatest success. great from a director who touches the olympus of how to make a blockbuster without losing the author's own blood.

It is a blockbuster that makes worth every peso that was spent intelligently and in a well-thought-out manner. The resources available are used in such a way that it is a contribution to what they are telling us and not an example of spending just to impress as usually happens. in several of these blockbusters and in that the intelligence of a director who no one can question when it comes to doubting that he knows about cinema and how to tell stories that captivate you.

The evolution of its script is also another step forward in the construction of its world to give us a film that finds in a solid narrative and completes the great triumph of a sequel much more brutal than its predecessor. The spectacular nature of its photography, the strength of its music and an unbeatable cast achieve the perfect mix to give us the need to continue having much more of this entire universe that Denis Villeneuve achieves.

It is directly one of the films that will mark history within big budgets and how to take advantage of them without losing what you really want to tell and in that sense one can take off one's hat to all those involved after the making of the entire Dune world, possibly one of the most complex adaptations to bring to the cinema, but they simply did it twice as well as we could have all imagined.

A film that is possibly established as one of the 3 best films that 2024 will give us.","1"

The sequel to Dune (2021) is the second two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune. The filming took place in Badapesti. 

The plot is both incredible, exciting and interesting.The film will show the formation of Paul Atreides and the psychologically difficult acceptance of his destiny as the messiah, from which the hero cannot hide in any way. But the main tension of the second part of ""Dune"" will center around the war of the people of Arrakis with the Harkonnens, which is hinted at by the frame where Paul Atreides stands on a mountain, looking at his people, as well as the frame of the duel between Paul and Feyd-Raut, a representative of the Harkonnen dynasty.

The cast is beautiful . Starring the character Paul Atreides, who played well-know Timothy Chalomet, and other characters such as Zendaya, who played Chani, and Lady Jessica, who was excellently played by Rebecca Ferguson, made the film powerful and intriguing. As for special effects, there is nothing better. 

Overall, Dune: Part Two is one of the best and most memorable films I've seen in a long time. I  have to  admit that this film left a huge impression on me and I want to say that you will not regret it if you watch this  excellent film)","1"

Chani doesn't believe in the prophecy, but she believes in Paul.  The movie ends with her stomping off into the desert alone.  That came across as too PC for me.  There are more.

This is an excellent movie, if you forget about the books! But on the other hand, it's hard to understand depicted world without having read the books. Changing the motivation of some characters changes everything. Some elements were left out, some were introduced that were not in the books. Some characters were practically removed! But strange compression of timeline makes the film just a collection of loosely connected scenes... All heavy cutted, scenes don't have time to resonate. PROS: The best depiction of Bene Geserit. Visually breathtaking (10/10). Geidi Prime - I like this style. Story told interestingly. Acting at a highest level (Chalamet!, Ferguson, Bardem, Skarsgard, Butler, even Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken in short scenes). Solid action. Sound and soundtrack - excellent. CONS: Some creative choices and changes. Timeline compression. Chani and Paul - total lack of chemistry... Zendaya still playing a spoiled girl from California, even more... Her acting skills are not up to par with other actors, sorry! Ending is atrocious, even when foreshadowing another part of the story, ""Dune Messiah"", in some twisted way... || Anyway: great to watch, a beautiful show, but part one was more consistent. Still MUST SEE - we need more sci-fi films of this quality, but with better world-building!","1"

He's a master world-builder, and the one he's created for Dune is simply unparalleled.  Every detail, from the harsh beauty of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, feels meticulously crafted and utterly believable.  The casting is spot-on too; each actor embodies their character perfectly, bringing depth and nuance to even the most minor roles.  And let's not forget the action!  The explosions are heart-stoppingly real, the fight choreography is top-notch, and every battle sequence is a visceral thrill ride.  Dune: Part Two is a masterclass in filmmaking, a rich and immersive experience that leaves you wanting desperately for more.  Part Three can't come soon enough!","1"

In fact,  since I also saw Dune I -- which wasn't that bad,  it has little to do with that, either.   If you've seen the original -- do yourself a big favor and skip this totally messed up non-version.  You'll hate it.  As a movie, the first 3/4 were just plain boring.  It didn't follow the original story -- looked like it took place in the Middle East with a cast and costumes seemingly taken out of the Arabian slums, and speaking what sounded like an Arabic dialogue.  I found that kind of offensive.  What followed was a tedious attempt at the characters trying to explain the plot as unsuccessfully as possible.  It was awful.  Then,  the last half hour or so -- you get a total revision on what the original Dune was -- but with lots of action.  If you could somehow manage to rid your mind of the actual story by Frank Herbert -- that last part wasn't that bad -- three stars for that part, but you had to sit thru about 90 minutes or more of pure torture to get to it.   Anyway -- terrible script.  Lousy story.   Great cinematography of lousy scenes and scenery -- the direction was awful.  I don't understand  how this got good ratings.","0"

I cannot remember a time when I was so enthralled by a film as I was when watching this remarkable sequel. It takes full advantage of the movie theater’s audio and visual superiority and, despite its longer-than-average runtime, keeps viewers actively engaged and hanging on every word and knife fight.
After a slow first entry to the new film depictions of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel series, Denis Villeneuve makes good use of the work cut out for him and only enhances it with his own contributions. The narrative, though expected by those familiar with the novels, is mostly foreign to Hollywood in its protagonist’s character arc—namely, in his downfall. Paul Atreides, seemingly justified in his pursuit of assimilating into the Fremen people to join in their rebellion against House Harkonnen, slowly crumbles under the pressure of those who suspect him to be the prophesied messiah figure of the Fremen. This downfall comes certainly as a surprise but is not unexplainable given his desire for vengeance, especially after the local Fremen village is destroyed by the Harkonnen.
The deep, underlying existential questions this film provokes are too innovative and refreshing. An example of this is how Paul’s rise to the Fremen throne highlights the reality that even the morally upright may be corrupted by unchecked access to power. His mission for justice quickly turns into a tyrannical bloodthirst as the one voice of reason, Chani, is drowned out by the voices of those singing his praise. The tragedy of their love story falling to pieces as he both pledges lifelong faithfulness to her and, in practically the same breath, takes the hand of Princess Irulan in a politically strategic betrothal was equally shocking since Dune: Part One left its audience anticipating only the continuation of their romance.
All in all, the groundbreaking elements of the plot, texture, and action sequences in Dune: Part Two left me eager for more. The underlying questions to do with corruption, oppression, and even messianic mythos offered unexpected depth. Call me a poor critic, but I don’t have anything negative to say about Villeneuve’s finest.","1"

Stir in an obligatory good ol' faithful Murrican servant (Josh Brolin) who'll introduce him to the REALLY good stuff (nukes), and offer a hit to Stellan Skarsgård's agent, and you're all set to fantasise about blowing Lawrence of Arabia out of the, er, sand dunes. Except that even the continuity people are hitting that stuff so hard that the hero gets up with the ultra-psycho's knife sticking out of the side it wasn't stuck into and wins by ditching the heroine and setting up the wafer-thin characters for yet another never-ending Western-in-Space franchise.

Just in case you don't spot it (after all, you've been stupid enough to spend hours on this), the script spells it out for you as a ""holy war"" to be continued. Dune 3, 4, 5,.... coming your way soon. (Luckily for Mr Skarsgård, his character has been written out: he should do the same for his agent.)

A few questions do remain: How did Charlotte Rampling allow herself to get dragged into a bit part here? Is there really an inverse relationship between special effects and character depth? Is Holyrood now just a figment of the all-American dream spurred on by fentanyl? Does anyone seriously care?","0"

(well, it's respectful to the original novel) Sand Worm, the Lord of the Sand, for transporting and hitting soldiers only? How come Sand Worm trumps high-tech? This film is not qualified to say ""a hunter"" – get some innovation from Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, okay? What a waste for the great existence of Sand Worms!

Dune Part 2 has great Cast, but adopts ""deep-fake science"" for a sci-fi film. A sci-fi film without the science portion, what's the difference between the gorgeous scenes in Dune Part 2 and the ridiculous Harkonnen ceremony in it?

Despite their menacing appearance, they seem to have a knack for running away from confrontation and couldn't hit the broad side of a sand dune if their lives depended on it. It kinda kills the suspense when you can predict the outcome of every skirmish with such certainty, because you know the Harkonnen are all bark no bite..
 However, my primary gripe with the movie lies in the portrayal of Zendaya's character, who serves as a major wet blanket throughout. The forced love story feels like a square peg in a round hole, derailing the epic potential of the narrative. Zendaya's character constantly second-guesses Paul and his journey, dragging down the momentum with her incessant doubt and pouting. Instead of adding depth to the story, she stalls every major scene that could have been exhilarating. To be clear Zendaya's was amazing, but her character was a total buzzkill. While I understand the industry's penchant for shoehorning love stories into every plot, this particular one feels like a missed opportunity and ultimately undermines the movie's impact.
On a positive note, the visual and auditory aspects of the film are top-notch. The stunning visuals and immersive sound design lend an eerie atmosphere that envelops the viewer from start to finish. Despite its flaws, I'm glad to have experienced it once. However, the combination of character missteps and laughably incompetent adversaries make it unlikely that I'll revisit this ""film"" anytime soon. 
*I use ""film"" in quotes because this production was captured digitally, not on traditional film stock.","2"

The mini-series actually moved more into the nuances of the story. This one...part One AND Two are a mockery. I understand that page to screen is difficult. That aside, what a mis-telling of the story this is. The character of Chani is completely shifted and Jessica gets destroyed as the power-hungry Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother of the Fremen. Changing the ending, to what? Get rid of the Baron without giving us a proper chance to despise his treachery, only drape him in spectacle with an unnecessary colosseum fight scene? And where is the nuance? Where is the understanding of Paul's training and skills? Stilgar as a fanatic? The only thing I will concede to is that it is stunning in scenery and costuming.

Stick with SYFY miniseries for author's vision, Villeneuve made good SciFi but sacrificed Herbert's complex mystical aspects and elegance. Instead we get highly edited modern attitudes and sensibilities. Herbert's Chani was the strong and loyal Fremen who was the center of Paul's life. Villeneuve has her mock Southern Fremen fundamentalism and abandons Paul. Its good Space Opera but lacks the substance of Herbert's Dune, misses its rewarding complexity. Read the book for something wonderful. While Lynch's 1984 Dune was a strange mélange, at least it retained some of Herbert's vision. Villeneuve is just Dune-Lite.","1"

Hours of desert, some of the worst acting—and casting—of all time. Timothea.. not even remotely believable as any kind of hero or warrior, temperamentally, physcially.. and with the charisma of a newt. His acting chops are simply non-existent, maybe the most lack lustre actor of his generation. Some good CGI here and there, but the whole dreary and somber portrayals of worlds and cultures are simply stereotypical, been there, done that. Well.. if you need something to put you to sleep, maybe. But even then, it is mainly annoying, and overall simply silly from start to finish.

I remember the hype around the first film when it came out, but I was not interested in seeing it and was unfamiliar with the franchise. I understood through the buzz that the movie was sci-fi, long, well-received, and had Zendaya. I still have not seen the first movie yet. 

That was my background knowledge about the movie before my father asked me if I wanted to watch Dune: Part Two with the family. I was hesitant about going as I told him the movie was long and that I had yet to see the first part. He was surprised and slightly offended by that. My father is a nerd but does not show it as much as others. I did not expect him to be so passionate about it. I was also surprised to hear that he had watched the first part multiple times since it came to streaming services. 

I agreed to see Dune: Part Two, thinking it would be a good time with family. I expected to enjoy the movie generally and only get slightly bored during the film's run time. My father would be happy, and that would have been more than enough for me. I watch a recap of the first part in the morning; we leave for the theater and sit in our seats in time for the film to start. 

I was enraptured throughout every part of the film. There was no moment when I was bored or too distracted by other things. This was surprising, considering the theater experience was unpleasant when I went this time. Each scene was beautiful, and it felt as if every frame was uniquely put together. I remember very specific thinking that I wanted to scrape through the screencaps and study every one of them for their composition and color. The accompanying music track was immersive, making the already stunning visuals come to life.","1"

With films like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and, of course, the first Dune from 2021, he knows how to make whatever he's directing feel huge, and so it is with Dune: Part 2, one of the few sequels I've actually been looking forward to in the last few years. The original film had a tough task of adapting an infamously complex story and mythology into a 2-and-a-half-hour movie, but it succeeded admirably. With Part 2, Villeneuve has gone the Empire Strikes Back route by pushing the story into much darker territories, and its all the better for it. There's a lot of things going on, several disparate plotlines that are destined to cross, and while we spend more time with some rather than others, it never feels like any of them are being forgotten or glossed over. With such a massive cast, big names like Christopher Walken & Florence Pugh get diminished screen time, but it never feels like they're turning in half-assed performances as a result. The one-on-one fight scenes are still cut a little erratically, but generally the action sequences are given scale and weight. You feel the pressure on our heroes as they battle a far larger and more powerful enemy, and I liked how the climactic battle came down to smart tactics and wise decision making, rather than just being another case of 2 big armies charging at each other and the winner being whoever has people left standing. Despite the undoubtedly grand scale, the film doesn't lose track of the human element, with Paul's romance with Chani, his contentious bond with his mother and his burgeoning alliance with the Fremen all given lots of screentime. Paul as a character goes through a lot in the course of the film, and by the end he's recognisably the same person, but moulded considerably by struggle and expectation. Austin Butler makes for a menacing, if underutilised villain who I would have liked to see more of. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably bombastic, but gets toned done or silenced when its appropriate. It's a film that practically begs to be seen on the big screen, and with a 3rd instalment already confirmed, it's difficult to see how they're going to top this one, but I'll be right there when they try.","1"

I also wasn't a fan of Chalamet in the first film - he just wasn't convincing in appearance nor performance, and it's even worse in this film. Dude seriously needs to get rid of that mop on his head and start hitting the gym, his 11 year old frame isn't convincing as a towel boy, let alone a leader who easily wins battles to the death over guys at least double his size. First film was an 8, this is a generous 7, all going to the visuals and everyone else's performance except Chalamet's.

""Dune Part 2: Disappointing Continuation of the Saga""

As a fervent fan of the original ""Dune"" novel, I approached ""Dune Part 2"" with great anticipation, only to find myself sorely disappointed. Frank Herbert's masterful universe seems to have lost its magic in this lackluster sequel.

One of the most glaring issues is the pacing. While the first book expertly balanced intricate world-building with gripping plot development, ""Dune Part 2"" drags on with tedious exposition and unnecessary tangents. The narrative feels bloated, weighed down by superfluous details that detract from the overall enjoyment.

Furthermore, the character development falls flat. In ""Dune,"" readers were treated to complex, multidimensional characters with motivations that resonated deeply. In contrast, the characters in ""Dune Part 2"" feel one-dimensional and uninspired, lacking the depth and complexity that made the original cast so compelling.

Additionally, the plot itself lacks the intrigue and suspense that made ""Dune"" such a gripping read. The stakes feel lower, the conflicts less engaging, and the resolutions predictable. It's as if Herbert ran out of creative steam, recycling tired tropes and clichés instead of pushing the boundaries of his own imagination.

Overall, ""Dune Part 2"" fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor. While it may hold some appeal for die-hard fans eager to revisit the world of Arrakis, casual readers are likely to find themselves bored and underwhelmed by this lackluster continuation of the saga.

Remember, this review is fictional and based on common criticisms. ""Dune"" and its potential sequels have garnered widespread acclaim, and opinions on any subsequent installments may vary widely.","0"

Yes there were bits missing, without adding spoilers I was slightly disappointed that lady Margot fenrings part was underplayed but boy it wasn't enough to detract from the sheer spectacle of what he achieved.

Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an  tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely.","0"

First, the good parts - the movie theater was clean and the reclining chairs were comfortable. Parking was fine too. The guy from the 8th Air Force did a good job playing a psycho. All this just shows how low the bar is in the US movie industry these days. 

Now for the rest - the story was shallow and credibility was damaged by shark jumping inplausibility. What did the freemen eat? How did they build and repair anything? How does anyone ever dismount from a sandworm? Has there ever been a more incompetent military defense or intelligence network than that of the Sarduakar? 

Just none of it makes any sense and the suspension of disbelief isn't possible, especially when the emotional stakes are so low and the characters are mostly stereotypes. 

It was acclaimed and has a good rating on this site. I suspect part of this is selection bias and the rest is of that is a reflection of the expectations of the day.

About the characters themselves: I don't like the way Jessica and Stilgar were portrayed (the psycho mother and the zealot). I missed the last scene in the book, the exchange between Jessica and Chani was superb. I guess we'll have to wait for a third movie, many things depend on that eventual closing episode.","2"

It's good 🙂
I'd recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼

Make sure you have the subtitles on, or you won't understand most of the movie…

Follow the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, Paul endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.","1"

The story was insanely hard-hitting, with twists and turns at every corner, which literally gave me a headache once the movie ended since there was so much to take in, truly. one of the most unpredictable stories in the history of cinema.

The writing was excellent as well - the writers don't get enough props on this movie. It is seriously one of the best cinematic pieces of writing of all time - if you guys ever watch this movie, you'll see what I mean.

The cinematography and the choreography combined were both amazing. The camerawork was able to catch every possible thing, along with some badass angles, and the fight choreography was beautiful. The fights felt insanely unpredictable as to who would win!

The cast performances were absolutely amazing. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsgard were all immediate standouts since the first movie. I hated that the first movie didn't get any acting nominations at the Oscars, so this one had better get all the nominations to make up for it, haha!

Do not get me started on the visual effects. Dune 2 is insanely beautiful - especially considering the fact that this movie was made on a budget twice as small as Avatar 2's budget! The world of Arrakis is insanely beautiful.

Hans Zimmer absolutely killed it with the musical score as well! Hans is one of the greatest movie composers of all time, and this movie just adds another stone to his crown.

Denis Villeneuve's direction in this movie was absolute perfection. I'd go as far as to say that Denis is the sci-fi genre's Martin Scorsese. That's just my opinion, though, to be brutally honest.

The pacing in this movie was also WAYYYYYY better than the first movie. The first movie dragged so long in the first half to pick up insanely quick in the second, but this movie cut straight to the chase, and I love that!

Dune: Part Two is a perfect payoff to Part One, while also standing as a perfect setup to Dune: Messiah which entered development today (April 4th, 2024), sporting compelling performances, stunning visuals, impeccable writing, and stellar direction, cinematography, and choreography, cementing Dune's legacy as one of the greatest sci-fi media franchises, and this movie alone standing at the top of the mountain as the greatest epic sci-fi movie of the 2020s.","1"

In my opinion this blows them all out of the water, not just because of the amazing visuals, but those are truly amazing because Denis insisted on doing everything as practical as possible. Even the sandworm seems like you could really go ride one! But, it is the way it handles the ""chosen one"" trope. I have seen it 7 times in the theater, all in IMAX or Dolby and I really recommend not  missing this one in the theater. Just like those other epic films, it will be around and discussed forever. I am glad if the third movie is made, it will not have Return of the.... in the title!","1"

It's the best movie I have seen this year by far. I dare say it was almost perfect. Okay, maybe not perfect, but it was crazy good, to say the least. My favorite aspect of the movie was the world-building and deep lore segments. The first movie left me with so many questions. But this sequel genuinely feels like they answered many of them. Don't get me wrong, I still have plenty more. Yet I feel satisfied as a viewer for the new information we got. But mainly, I'm excited to learn more.

To get movie-specific Dune: Part Two feels more like a coming-out party for Paul. As the main protagonist or antagonist depending on who you ask Paul's rise was epic. It felt like he couldn't miss in this movie and Stilgar was there to remind the whole movie. Seeing Paul rise to the occasion again and again did have me hyped I can't lie.

The movie has a hero's journey-type vibe with a little ""chosen one"" energy sprinkled on top. Yet you can tell that the plot is a lot deeper than Paul's storyline alone. Matter of fact you can tell it's a lot deeper than these first two movies. I loved how fluent the cast rotation was for this movie. For the most part, they did a great job establishing new characters as we lose old ones. It makes the movie feel more alive.

One thing that I didn't like about this movie was the big battles or war portions of the movie. It felt way too one-sided and seems to be a continued trend from the first film. The issue is that it makes all the preparations and conversations pointless. Granted, I don't get tired of seeing the Freman pop up out of the ground ready to rumble. I wish there was some real pushback from the opposing sides. I don't care how much prep time they have.

Let's switch up the pace a little bit. I want to talk a little about the love interests. Something we were robbed of in the first movie. They killed it this go around. The newfound triangle between Paul, Chani, and Princess Irulan is going to be one for the ages. The reason is that we spent most of the movie seeing Paul and Chani boo love. While Princess Irulan was playing politics. Things are bound to get tricky with Paul's newfound position. Plus his political union with the princess. Paul is playing a dangerous game if you ask me.

Zendaya's portrayal of Chani was great. She not only grounded the movie but also stuck to her convictions regardless of what Paul had going on. This will set up some interesting conflicts in the future. Paul is going to have to make some tough decisions that are not so black-and-white. I just hope Chani will be around to help make them. 

The future looks bright for Dune. Learning about the empire and their roles in the prophecy was poetic. Plus with talks of a holy war things are going to get interesting fast. I am excited to see what Paul can come up with to keep the power he never really wanted. But this movie in general was really good. They made it feel like one big puzzle where you don't know what the image is going to be until the end. It feels like there's still so much to discover which is why I gave it a 9/10 G-Files score.

Seeing Paul becoming one with the desert is one thing. But seeing him gain the trust of the people is a whole other thing. Timothée Chalamet's speech was incredible. This movie takes the necessary steps to fully flush out its characters good or bad. You expect to see Paul embrace the title of Muad'Dib. His pursuit of revenge, vengeance, or freedom from the powers at be. It makes sense. You don't expect to be thrown into this chasm of politics, secret agendas, and visions of people not even born yet. This movie was amazing and I can't wait for the next one to come out.","1"

I made a mistake when I was watching it for the first time: I was trying to be critical. Don't do that. So for the second watch I went to an IMAX theater so that I could just enjoy it and I did. This movie is absolutely incredible. The cinematography is one of the best of all movies I'v seen. You feel like you're there on Arrakis, the characters feel real, their emotions feel real. The music is just incredibly cinematic. The visual effects are stunning. The sandworm-riding was the best part of the movie, it always looked more gorgeous each time we saw it. I cannot say the pacing is perfect, but it's certainly very good. During the first time watch I felt a little bored in the beginning.

The characters are all very interesting, my favourite being Stilgar of course, who probably deliveres all the jokes of the film. Javier Bardem is just amazing, but the best acting pefromance was given by Austin Butler. He was so intense. Timotheé Chalamet was also really good. these two are probably going to be nominated for a lot of awards. But everyone was great, I especially love Stellan Skarsgard's Vladimir Harkonnen.

All in all this movie is absolutely incredible, it's no question that it's a 10/10. Years later, when people look back on 2024, this film will probably come to their mind.","1"

One star is because it is not original at all.

I don't know what other movie can top this movie aside from planet of the eighth, but other than that this was a joy to watch but to let people know that this is definitely a sequel. There are some parts that you might be confused on so if you have not watched part one, please do before going into this, now this picks up right where it left off like five minutes ago where in the first dune Paul is traveling with the Freeman alongside her mother, and they are trying to apprehend the Harkenns. Throughout this movie, you can see a transformation in Paul in the downfall of Paul at the same time he is trying to lead the Freman to Paradise, but he keeps seeing visions if he tries or even attempts to lead them to paradise the performances in this movie is really good and the first one  I thought Timothy Chalamet was kind of a little weak but in this, he has a lot to work with and it's done very well. I have not read the book so I am confused on Florence Pugh character but other than that I was in with the story just like the first one every performance is really good, especially Javier Bardem, and Austin Butler, who really steals the show this is a visual masterpiece. Every single shot is so well done keep having these change of color pallets and it don't feel like a green screen or nothing and feels like you're into this world. Zendaya was pretty cool and really fits the character. Well sometimes I'd be questioning her acting but it's OK because in this she was really good, and this is actually a deeper dive into its theme and it's theme of religion. Is religion a manipulative tool or is religion the right way to go that's how I viewed the movie on its theme. Javier Bardem and represents the manipulative tool and Zendaya is the opposite and the final battle between Austin Butler's character and Timothée Chalamet character was so intense, and to be honest, I didn't know which one to root forwork, for, i was trying to rule for Timothée Chalamet‘s character, but I realize that he is now mixed in and following the visions that he don't want to follow in Austin Butler's character was so entertaining to watch that I really want to see more of him but overall this was a fantastic movie and tell me that they're going to kill Timothée Chalamet‘s character in part three because I want to see some real good consequences since these visions are now explored and well executed and in my humble opinion, this is my movie year 9.5/10","1"

The cast delivers impeccable portrayals of their characters, enhancing the depth and authenticity of the narrative.

One of the film's standout features is its immersive exploration of diverse planetary landscapes, each meticulously crafted to reflect its unique culture and aesthetic. I particularly appreciated how each community showcased its distinct traditions and costumes, adding layers of depth and authenticity to the world-building.

The fight sequences are masterfully choreographed, showcasing both visual prowess and emotional resonance. Admirably, ""Dune 2"" remains faithful to the source material, incorporating rich lore from Frank Herbert's seminal novels while also offering fresh interpretations and surprises for fans and newcomers alike.

In summary, ""Dune 2"" is a cinematic tour de force that excels in both style and substance, offering audiences a compelling and unforgettable journey into the vast and intricate universe of Dune.","1"

If not for having gone to see it with friends, I would have been perfectly fine walking out halfway, streaming it and fast forwarding to see the key moments. To me, it was not nearly as visually interesting. It was so devoid of the depth of character and relationship nuance explored in the Part 1. The complex (and possibly unhealthy) relationship between Paul and his mother that was so central in Part 1 is totally absent in Part 2. They hardly share any screen time together. Paul's ascension isn't believable, to me, nor is his change later in the movie. For me, there are other issues as well. Overall, this was hugely disappointing.","0"

I've watched it twice already, and the soundtrack still gives me goosebumps in my headphones. I can't imagine how it can be surpassed in a third movie, but I'm looking forward to it.","1"

"","Phillip L","","Apr 1, 2024","I had previously seen Part one and the 1984 version about 18 months ago.  I was totally lost.
Didn't know who was who, and what was going on.  Totally lost.  There will be a sequel or more.
I'm sure some people who read books about it must have had some idea what was going on.","0"
