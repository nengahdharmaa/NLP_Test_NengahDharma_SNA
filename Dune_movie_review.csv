A cinematic landmark. It is marred only by the fact that the plotting is a bore. The novel is an intricate world with multiple conflicts and story threads. But this movie doesn't translate those characters and conflicts into a dramatic story. Some say Paul is the chosen one, some say he's not   - -he gets put through the wringer,  and then guess what? That's the film in a nutshell though a spoiler wouldn't ruin anything for you because you need to see this film and experience it for the genius and craft of a master filmmaker."

They are both decent movies, but I feel they try too hard to appease those who read the book. To no avail I might add. They go into too much minute detail that feels better suited for a directors cut. These precious minutes could of kept the flow much smoother and more palatable for the average audience. Personally I don't like the visuals entirely because there's not enough color. I think it's deliberate to highlight the eyes but it's a detail that makes all the good work done seem a little more drab. All that said there is enough story progression and new information to keep the saga entraining. Though the obvious savior complex going on is soooo annoying."

They significantly changes out major characters for no reason and dumbed down the freman.  If you really want to see a version that is worth watching checkout the two miniseries that followed the books and were much more visually stunning.  This version was a waste of my time and money.  That fact it has such high ratings must be due to people who never read the books."

Paul's character development and the significant change he undergoes in this film deserve recognition. Unlike Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin/Vader, Timothee's performance doesn't fall into the trap of making Paul seem like a spoiled kid. The visuals and locations are top-notch with stunning scenery throughout the movie. While the plot may not be the most intricate and you might have a sense of where it's headed, the film still keeps you hooked until the end, offering a fresh and engaging experience. Personally, I feel that the Harkonnen cousins (sorry, their names escape me) deserved more screen time or at least more memorable deaths, given the praise they received from fans and media. Overall, both Dune movies together make for a fantastic viewing session, although they might not reach epic status or be remembered for years to come. But if you're considering watching them, I say go for it—both movies are definitely worth it for their captivating visuals alone."

This may sound odd, but for a 3 hour movie, it felt rushed.  There was definitely some overediting and missing, much needed scenes that were left out.

I have loved Dune since I first read it in the early 90's.
I've watched every show/movie and read all the books.
So I'm invested.
That's why I don't get what Villeneuve (sp) is trying to pull here.
Chani would have NEVER left Paul. Not even considered it.
In fact, it was Chani's idea that she and Paul not marry, in case he needed to marry the Princess, which he did.
But it was Chani that bore his children. It was Chani that loved and supported him through it all.

And why the hell is Alia still in the womb? She should've been around the age of 4-6 by the time Fayd and Paul went head to head.

Why alienate the die-hards just to push a goofball narrative? Who's camp is he trying to appeal to by making these ridiculous changes?"

The story is where it looses me. I have loved the Dune books for decades. I have read the original Dune probably 25 times. I love the world building Herbert did. Chani is one of the biggest let downs for me in this movie. In the books she loved Paul and supported him in everything. She might not have liked it but she never walked away from Paul. She was one of his biggest supporters. They talked about never getting married so he could marry the princess and rule the empire.

Visually speaking, the movie is just gorgeus and you can't take your eyes off the screen.

The action scenes were also nice, although i wish it had more of them, or at least more variety; maybe upon second vieweing my opinion will change, but they seemed a bit repetitive. That's just a very minor complaint tho. It is understandable that there is a story to tell and only so much you can do in a desert, action wise.

It is also annoying that it ends on another kind of cliffhanger, but in a franchise like this, that is perhaps more suited for a tv series, it's impossible not to end in one. 
The fact that Dennis Villeneuve managed - with a limited near 3 hour runtime - to insert so much lore, characters, and deliver on the action, in a way that both Dune fans and newcomers feel happy, is an incredible accomplishment.

Impatiently waiting for part 3(and who knows, more?)."

Synopsis

After the events of the first part that occurred on the planet Arrakis, the young Paul Atreides joins the Fremen tribe and begins a spiritual and martial journey to become a messiah, while trying to avoid the horrible, but inevitable future that he has witnessed: a Holy War in his name, which spans the entire known universe .

When Dune was released in 2021, the impossible seemed to have been achieved with the tremendous adaptation that the Canadian director achieved, but only he could surpass himself and improve his first film to give us an even bigger and even more epic spectacle in his amazing sequel. This author's blockbuster is once again present, giving us a truly satisfactory film that is positioned right among the best of 2024, without any doubt about that.

Denis Villeneuve knows how to make everything more intense in this second installment and know how to give us a tour of intense moments, somewhat complex and highly dialogued, but that captivate you as everything happens thanks to the fact that the director knows how to captivate you with the music, the photography, the desert and its characters that develop a personality with which you are part of the entire ascent until the masterful final climax with which the director breaks all the schemes and demonstrates the greatness that his masterpiece represents. It may have a few defects, because the truth is it does, but they are insignificant compared to the final result of a complex work to be adapted, but which Denis Villeneuve makes seem so simple once projected on the screen and that is clearly the greatest success. great from a director who touches the olympus of how to make a blockbuster without losing the author's own blood.

It is a blockbuster that makes worth every peso that was spent intelligently and in a well-thought-out manner. The resources available are used in such a way that it is a contribution to what they are telling us and not an example of spending just to impress as usually happens. in several of these blockbusters and in that the intelligence of a director who no one can question when it comes to doubting that he knows about cinema and how to tell stories that captivate you.

The evolution of its script is also another step forward in the construction of its world to give us a film that finds in a solid narrative and completes the great triumph of a sequel much more brutal than its predecessor. The spectacular nature of its photography, the strength of its music and an unbeatable cast achieve the perfect mix to give us the need to continue having much more of this entire universe that Denis Villeneuve achieves.

It is directly one of the films that will mark history within big budgets and how to take advantage of them without losing what you really want to tell and in that sense one can take off one's hat to all those involved after the making of the entire Dune world, possibly one of the most complex adaptations to bring to the cinema, but they simply did it twice as well as we could have all imagined.

A film that is possibly established as one of the 3 best films that 2024 will give us."

The sequel to Dune (2021) is the second two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune. The filming took place in Badapesti. 

The plot is both incredible, exciting and interesting.The film will show the formation of Paul Atreides and the psychologically difficult acceptance of his destiny as the messiah, from which the hero cannot hide in any way. But the main tension of the second part of ""Dune"" will center around the war of the people of Arrakis with the Harkonnens, which is hinted at by the frame where Paul Atreides stands on a mountain, looking at his people, as well as the frame of the duel between Paul and Feyd-Raut, a representative of the Harkonnen dynasty.

The cast is beautiful . Starring the character Paul Atreides, who played well-know Timothy Chalomet, and other characters such as Zendaya, who played Chani, and Lady Jessica, who was excellently played by Rebecca Ferguson, made the film powerful and intriguing. As for special effects, there is nothing better. 

Overall, Dune: Part Two is one of the best and most memorable films I've seen in a long time. I  have to  admit that this film left a huge impression on me and I want to say that you will not regret it if you watch this  excellent film)"

Chani doesn't believe in the prophecy, but she believes in Paul.  The movie ends with her stomping off into the desert alone.  That came across as too PC for me.  There are more.

This is an excellent movie, if you forget about the books! But on the other hand, it's hard to understand depicted world without having read the books. Changing the motivation of some characters changes everything. Some elements were left out, some were introduced that were not in the books. Some characters were practically removed! But strange compression of timeline makes the film just a collection of loosely connected scenes... All heavy cutted, scenes don't have time to resonate. PROS: The best depiction of Bene Geserit. Visually breathtaking (10/10). Geidi Prime - I like this style. Story told interestingly. Acting at a highest level (Chalamet!, Ferguson, Bardem, Skarsgard, Butler, even Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken in short scenes). Solid action. Sound and soundtrack - excellent. CONS: Some creative choices and changes. Timeline compression. Chani and Paul - total lack of chemistry... Zendaya still playing a spoiled girl from California, even more... Her acting skills are not up to par with other actors, sorry! Ending is atrocious, even when foreshadowing another part of the story, ""Dune Messiah"", in some twisted way... || Anyway: great to watch, a beautiful show, but part one was more consistent.

For years, I thought adapting Frank Herbert's masterpiece was a fool's errand.  But then Denis Villeneuve stepped in, and let me tell you, the man's a visionary.  He's a master world-builder, and the one he's created for Dune is simply unparalleled.  Every detail, from the harsh beauty of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, feels meticulously crafted and utterly believable.  The casting is spot-on too; each actor embodies their character perfectly, bringing depth and nuance to even the most minor roles.  And let's not forget the action!  The explosions are heart-stoppingly real, the fight choreography is top-notch, and every battle sequence is a visceral thrill ride.  Dune: Part Two is a masterclass in filmmaking, a rich and immersive experience that leaves you wanting desperately for more.  Part Three can't come soon enough!"

In fact,  since I also saw Dune I -- which wasn't that bad,  it has little to do with that, either.   If you've seen the original -- do yourself a big favor and skip this totally messed up non-version.  You'll hate it.  As a movie, the first 3/4 were just plain boring.  It didn't follow the original story -- looked like it took place in the Middle East with a cast and costumes seemingly taken out of the Arabian slums, and speaking what sounded like an Arabic dialogue.  I found that kind of offensive.  What followed was a tedious attempt at the characters trying to explain the plot as unsuccessfully as possible.  It was awful.  Then,  the last half hour or so -- you get a total revision on what the original Dune was -- but with lots of action.  If you could somehow manage to rid your mind of the actual story by Frank Herbert -- that last part wasn't that bad -- three stars for that part, but you had to sit thru about 90 minutes or more of pure torture to get to it.   Anyway -- terrible script.  Lousy story.   Great cinematography of lousy scenes and scenery -- the direction was awful.  I don't understand  how this got good ratings."

I cannot remember a time when I was so enthralled by a film as I was when watching this remarkable sequel. It takes full advantage of the movie theater’s audio and visual superiority and, despite its longer-than-average runtime, keeps viewers actively engaged and hanging on every word and knife fight.
After a slow first entry to the new film depictions of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel series, Denis Villeneuve makes good use of the work cut out for him and only enhances it with his own contributions. The narrative, though expected by those familiar with the novels, is mostly foreign to Hollywood in its protagonist’s character arc—namely, in his downfall. Paul Atreides, seemingly justified in his pursuit of assimilating into the Fremen people to join in their rebellion against House Harkonnen, slowly crumbles under the pressure of those who suspect him to be the prophesied messiah figure of the Fremen. This downfall comes certainly as a surprise but is not unexplainable given his desire for vengeance, especially after the local Fremen village is destroyed by the Harkonnen.
The deep, underlying existential questions this film provokes are too innovative and refreshing. An example of this is how Paul’s rise to the Fremen throne highlights the reality that even the morally upright may be corrupted by unchecked access to power. His mission for justice quickly turns into a tyrannical bloodthirst as the one voice of reason, Chani, is drowned out by the voices of those singing his praise. The tragedy of their love story falling to pieces as he both pledges lifelong faithfulness to her and, in practically the same breath, takes the hand of Princess Irulan in a politically strategic betrothal was equally shocking since Dune: Part One left its audience anticipating only the continuation of their romance.
All in all, the groundbreaking elements of the plot, texture, and action sequences in Dune: Part Two left me eager for more. The underlying questions to do with corruption, oppression, and even messianic mythos offered unexpected depth. Call me a poor critic, but I don’t have anything negative to say about Villeneuve’s finest."

By circumventing a traditional Three-Act story structure and doubling down on the visual evolution of the trilogy, Part Two elaborates, harmonizes, and bursts at the seam with artistic richness far beyond what part one was capable of.

Stir in an obligatory good ol' faithful Murrican servant (Josh Brolin) who'll introduce him to the REALLY good stuff (nukes), and offer a hit to Stellan Skarsgård's agent, and you're all set to fantasise about blowing Lawrence of Arabia out of the, er, sand dunes. Except that even the continuity people are hitting that stuff so hard that the hero gets up with the ultra-psycho's knife sticking out of the side it wasn't stuck into and wins by ditching the heroine and setting up the wafer-thin characters for yet another never-ending Western-in-Space franchise.

Just in case you don't spot it (after all, you've been stupid enough to spend hours on this), the script spells it out for you as a ""holy war"" to be continued. Dune 3, 4, 5,.... coming your way soon. (Luckily for Mr Skarsgård, his character has been written out: he should do the same for his agent.)

A few questions do remain: How did Charlotte Rampling allow herself to get dragged into a bit part here? Is there really an inverse relationship between special effects and character depth? Is Holyrood now just a figment of the all-American dream spurred on by fentanyl? Does anyone seriously care?"

(well, it's respectful to the original novel) Sand Worm, the Lord of the Sand, for transporting and hitting soldiers only? How come Sand Worm trumps high-tech? This film is not qualified to say ""a hunter"" – get some innovation from Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, okay? What a waste for the great existence of Sand Worms!

Dune Part 2 has great Cast, but adopts ""deep-fake science"" for a sci-fi film. A sci-fi film without the science portion, what's the difference between the gorgeous scenes in Dune Part 2 and the ridiculous Harkonnen ceremony in it?

Despite their menacing appearance, they seem to have a knack for running away from confrontation and couldn't hit the broad side of a sand dune if their lives depended on it. It kinda kills the suspense when you can predict the outcome of every skirmish with such certainty, because you know the Harkonnen are all bark no bite..
 However, my primary gripe with the movie lies in the portrayal of Zendaya's character, who serves as a major wet blanket throughout. The forced love story feels like a square peg in a round hole, derailing the epic potential of the narrative. Zendaya's character constantly second-guesses Paul and his journey, dragging down the momentum with her incessant doubt and pouting. Instead of adding depth to the story, she stalls every major scene that could have been exhilarating. To be clear Zendaya's was amazing, but her character was a total buzzkill. While I understand the industry's penchant for shoehorning love stories into every plot, this particular one feels like a missed opportunity and ultimately undermines the movie's impact.
On a positive note, the visual and auditory aspects of the film are top-notch. The stunning visuals and immersive sound design lend an eerie atmosphere that envelops the viewer from start to finish. Despite its flaws, I'm glad to have experienced it once. However, the combination of character missteps and laughably incompetent adversaries make it unlikely that I'll revisit this ""film"" anytime soon. 
*I use ""film"" in quotes because this production was captured digitally, not on traditional film stock."

That aside, what a mis-telling of the story this is. The character of Chani is completely shifted and Jessica gets destroyed as the power-hungry Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother of the Fremen.

Stick with SYFY miniseries for author's vision, Villeneuve made good SciFi but sacrificed Herbert's complex mystical aspects and elegance. Instead we get highly edited modern attitudes and sensibilities. Herbert's Chani was the strong and loyal Fremen who was the center of Paul's life. Villeneuve has her mock Southern Fremen fundamentalism and abandons Paul. Its good Space Opera but lacks the substance of Herbert's Dune, misses its rewarding complexity. Read the book for something wonderful. While Lynch's 1984 Dune was a strange mélange, at least it retained some of Herbert's vision. Villeneuve is just Dune-Lite."

Hours of desert, some of the worst acting—and casting—of all time. Timothea.. not even remotely believable as any kind of hero or warrior, temperamentally, physcially.. and with the charisma of a newt. His acting chops are simply non-existent, maybe the most lack lustre actor of his generation. Some good CGI here and there, but the whole dreary and somber portrayals of worlds and cultures are simply stereotypical, been there, done that. Well.. if you need something to put you to sleep, maybe. But even then, it is mainly annoying, and overall simply silly from start to finish.

The acting was literally out of this world I can for see Timothee getting that Oscar nomination as written!! 😂 But seriously towards the end of the movie we see where Denis blended pieces of dune messiah into part two and it was incredible to see Timothee truly transform into the person Paul was always inevitably going to become and be going forward.

I remember the hype around the first film when it came out, but I was not interested in seeing it and was unfamiliar with the franchise. I understood through the buzz that the movie was sci-fi, long, well-received, and had Zendaya. I still have not seen the first movie yet. 

That was my background knowledge about the movie before my father asked me if I wanted to watch Dune: Part Two with the family. I was hesitant about going as I told him the movie was long and that I had yet to see the first part. He was surprised and slightly offended by that. My father is a nerd but does not show it as much as others. I did not expect him to be so passionate about it. I was also surprised to hear that he had watched the first part multiple times since it came to streaming services. 

I agreed to see Dune: Part Two, thinking it would be a good time with family. I expected to enjoy the movie generally and only get slightly bored during the film's run time. My father would be happy, and that would have been more than enough for me. I watch a recap of the first part in the morning; we leave for the theater and sit in our seats in time for the film to start. 

I was enraptured throughout every part of the film. There was no moment when I was bored or too distracted by other things. This was surprising, considering the theater experience was unpleasant when I went this time. Each scene was beautiful, and it felt as if every frame was uniquely put together. I remember very specific thinking that I wanted to scrape through the screencaps and study every one of them for their composition and color. The accompanying music track was immersive, making the already stunning visuals come to life."

With films like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and, of course, the first Dune from 2021, he knows how to make whatever he's directing feel huge, and so it is with Dune: Part 2, one of the few sequels I've actually been looking forward to in the last few years. The original film had a tough task of adapting an infamously complex story and mythology into a 2-and-a-half-hour movie, but it succeeded admirably. With Part 2, Villeneuve has gone the Empire Strikes Back route by pushing the story into much darker territories, and its all the better for it. There's a lot of things going on, several disparate plotlines that are destined to cross, and while we spend more time with some rather than others, it never feels like any of them are being forgotten or glossed over. With such a massive cast, big names like Christopher Walken & Florence Pugh get diminished screen time, but it never feels like they're turning in half-assed performances as a result. The one-on-one fight scenes are still cut a little erratically, but generally the action sequences are given scale and weight. You feel the pressure on our heroes as they battle a far larger and more powerful enemy, and I liked how the climactic battle came down to smart tactics and wise decision making, rather than just being another case of 2 big armies charging at each other and the winner being whoever has people left standing. Despite the undoubtedly grand scale, the film doesn't lose track of the human element, with Paul's romance with Chani, his contentious bond with his mother and his burgeoning alliance with the Fremen all given lots of screentime. Paul as a character goes through a lot in the course of the film, and by the end he's recognisably the same person, but moulded considerably by struggle and expectation. Austin Butler makes for a menacing, if underutilised villain who I would have liked to see more of. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably bombastic, but gets toned done or silenced when its appropriate. It's a film that practically begs to be seen on the big screen, and with a 3rd instalment already confirmed, it's difficult to see how they're going to top this one, but I'll be right there when they try."

I also wasn't a fan of Chalamet in the first film - he just wasn't convincing in appearance nor performance, and it's even worse in this film. Dude seriously needs to get rid of that mop on his head and start hitting the gym, his 11 year old frame isn't convincing as a towel boy, let alone a leader who easily wins battles to the death over guys at least double his size. First film was an 8, this is a generous 7, all going to the visuals and everyone else's performance except Chalamet's. Hopefully the writing and Chalamet's pubescent growth improves in the third and final film."

""Dune Part 2: Disappointing Continuation of the Saga""

As a fervent fan of the original ""Dune"" novel, I approached ""Dune Part 2"" with great anticipation, only to find myself sorely disappointed. Frank Herbert's masterful universe seems to have lost its magic in this lackluster sequel.

One of the most glaring issues is the pacing. While the first book expertly balanced intricate world-building with gripping plot development, ""Dune Part 2"" drags on with tedious exposition and unnecessary tangents. The narrative feels bloated, weighed down by superfluous details that detract from the overall enjoyment.

Furthermore, the character development falls flat. In ""Dune,"" readers were treated to complex, multidimensional characters with motivations that resonated deeply. In contrast, the characters in ""Dune Part 2"" feel one-dimensional and uninspired, lacking the depth and complexity that made the original cast so compelling.

Additionally, the plot itself lacks the intrigue and suspense that made ""Dune"" such a gripping read. The stakes feel lower, the conflicts less engaging, and the resolutions predictable. It's as if Herbert ran out of creative steam, recycling tired tropes and clichés instead of pushing the boundaries of his own imagination.

Overall, ""Dune Part 2"" fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor. While it may hold some appeal for die-hard fans eager to revisit the world of Arrakis, casual readers are likely to find themselves bored and underwhelmed by this lackluster continuation of the saga.

---

Remember, this review is fictional and based on common criticisms. ""Dune"" and its potential sequels have garnered widespread acclaim, and opinions on any subsequent installments may vary widely."

Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an  tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely."

First, the good parts - the movie theater was clean and the reclining chairs were comfortable. Parking was fine too. The guy from the 8th Air Force did a good job playing a psycho. All this just shows how low the bar is in the US movie industry these days. 

Now for the rest - the story was shallow and credibility was damaged by shark jumping inplausibility. What did the freemen eat? How did they build and repair anything? How does anyone ever dismount from a sandworm? Has there ever been a more incompetent military defense or intelligence network than that of the Sarduakar? 

Just none of it makes any sense and the suspension of disbelief isn't possible, especially when the emotional stakes are so low and the characters are mostly stereotypes. 

It was acclaimed and has a good rating on this site. I suspect part of this is selection bias and the rest is of that is a reflection of the expectations of the day.

About the characters themselves: I don't like the way Jessica and Stilgar were portrayed (the psycho mother and the zealot). I missed the last scene in the book, the exchange between Jessica and Chani was superb. I guess we'll have to wait for a third movie, many things depend on that eventual closing episode."

Dune: Part Two is a 2024 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by Denis Villeneuve 🍿 

It's good 🙂
I'd recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼

Make sure you have the subtitles on, or you won't understand most of the movie…

Follow the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, Paul endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee."

The shots that showcase the scope of the story and the colors of every location look beautiful, even in the most dire and hostile of places. There's a lot of thought that went into every shot throughout the long runtime, which really doesn't feel like it drags at any point. The characters and dialogue are great, which compliments their placement in the celestial environments. As the second part of an ongoing saga, DUNE Part 2 will give you reason to revisit the first film in an attempt to stay immersed within the universe it shows you."

The story was insanely hard-hitting, with twists and turns at every corner, which literally gave me a headache once the movie ended since there was so much to take in, truly. one of the most unpredictable stories in the history of cinema.

The writing was excellent as well - the writers don't get enough props on this movie. It is seriously one of the best cinematic pieces of writing of all time - if you guys ever watch this movie, you'll see what I mean.

The cinematography and the choreography combined were both amazing. The camerawork was able to catch every possible thing, along with some badass angles, and the fight choreography was beautiful. The fights felt insanely unpredictable as to who would win!

The cast performances were absolutely amazing. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsgard were all immediate standouts since the first movie. I hated that the first movie didn't get any acting nominations at the Oscars, so this one had better get all the nominations to make up for it, haha!

Do not get me started on the visual effects. Dune 2 is insanely beautiful - especially considering the fact that this movie was made on a budget twice as small as Avatar 2's budget! The world of Arrakis is insanely beautiful.

Hans Zimmer absolutely killed it with the musical score as well! Hans is one of the greatest movie composers of all time, and this movie just adds another stone to his crown.

Denis Villeneuve's direction in this movie was absolute perfection. I'd go as far as to say that Denis is the sci-fi genre's Martin Scorsese. That's just my opinion, though, to be brutally honest.

The pacing in this movie was also WAYYYYYY better than the first movie. The first movie dragged so long in the first half to pick up insanely quick in the second, but this movie cut straight to the chase, and I love that!

Dune: Part Two is a perfect payoff to Part One, while also standing as a perfect setup to Dune: Messiah which entered development today (April 4th, 2024), sporting compelling performances, stunning visuals, impeccable writing, and stellar direction, cinematography, and choreography, cementing Dune's legacy as one of the greatest sci-fi media franchises, and this movie alone standing at the top of the mountain as the greatest epic sci-fi movie of the 2020s."

The movie is absolutely stunning to see. Almost every shot could be framed & put on a wall without anyone thinking twice.

Basically, this is an overly expensive coffee table book."

It's the best movie I have seen this year by far. I dare say it was almost perfect. Okay, maybe not perfect, but it was crazy good, to say the least. My favorite aspect of the movie was the world-building and deep lore segments. The first movie left me with so many questions. But this sequel genuinely feels like they answered many of them. Don't get me wrong, I still have plenty more. Yet I feel satisfied as a viewer for the new information we got. But mainly, I'm excited to learn more.

To get movie-specific Dune: Part Two feels more like a coming-out party for Paul. As the main protagonist or antagonist depending on who you ask Paul's rise was epic. It felt like he couldn't miss in this movie and Stilgar was there to remind the whole movie. Seeing Paul rise to the occasion again and again did have me hyped I can't lie.

The movie has a hero's journey-type vibe with a little ""chosen one"" energy sprinkled on top. Yet you can tell that the plot is a lot deeper than Paul's storyline alone. Matter of fact you can tell it's a lot deeper than these first two movies. I loved how fluent the cast rotation was for this movie. For the most part, they did a great job establishing new characters as we lose old ones. It makes the movie feel more alive.

One thing that I didn't like about this movie was the big battles or war portions of the movie. It felt way too one-sided and seems to be a continued trend from the first film. The issue is that it makes all the preparations and conversations pointless. Granted, I don't get tired of seeing the Freman pop up out of the ground ready to rumble. I wish there was some real pushback from the opposing sides. I don't care how much prep time they have.

Let's switch up the pace a little bit. I want to talk a little about the love interests. Something we were robbed of in the first movie. They killed it this go around. The newfound triangle between Paul, Chani, and Princess Irulan is going to be one for the ages. The reason is that we spent most of the movie seeing Paul and Chani boo love. While Princess Irulan was playing politics. Things are bound to get tricky with Paul's newfound position. Plus his political union with the princess. Paul is playing a dangerous game if you ask me.

Zendaya's portrayal of Chani was great. She not only grounded the movie but also stuck to her convictions regardless of what Paul had going on. This will set up some interesting conflicts in the future. Paul is going to have to make some tough decisions that are not so black-and-white. I just hope Chani will be around to help make them. 

The future looks bright for Dune. Learning about the empire and their roles in the prophecy was poetic. Plus with talks of a holy war things are going to get interesting fast. I am excited to see what Paul can come up with to keep the power he never really wanted. But this movie in general was really good. They made it feel like one big puzzle where you don't know what the image is going to be until the end. It feels like there's still so much to discover which is why I gave it a 9/10 G-Files score.

Seeing Paul becoming one with the desert is one thing. But seeing him gain the trust of the people is a whole other thing. Timothée Chalamet's speech was incredible. This movie takes the necessary steps to fully flush out its characters good or bad. You expect to see Paul embrace the title of Muad'Dib. His pursuit of revenge, vengeance, or freedom from the powers at be. It makes sense. You don't expect to be thrown into this chasm of politics, secret agendas, and visions of people not even born yet. This movie was amazing and I can't wait for the next one to come out."

I made a mistake when I was watching it for the first time: I was trying to be critical. Don't do that. So for the second watch I went to an IMAX theater so that I could just enjoy it and I did. This movie is absolutely incredible. The cinematography is one of the best of all movies I'v seen. You feel like you're there on Arrakis, the characters feel real, their emotions feel real. The music is just incredibly cinematic. The visual effects are stunning. The sandworm-riding was the best part of the movie, it always looked more gorgeous each time we saw it. I cannot say the pacing is perfect, but it's certainly very good. During the first time watch I felt a little bored in the beginning.

The characters are all very interesting, my favourite being Stilgar of course, who probably deliveres all the jokes of the film. Javier Bardem is just amazing, but the best acting pefromance was given by Austin Butler. He was so intense. Timotheé Chalamet was also really good. these two are probably going to be nominated for a lot of awards. But everyone was great, I especially love Stellan Skarsgard's Vladimir Harkonnen.

All in all this movie is absolutely incredible, it's no question that it's a 10/10. Years later, when people look back on 2024, this film will probably come to their mind."

One star is because it is not original at all. 

First of all, It's yet another adaptation of a story that's already been told.
Then, It's a mix of multiple films: Matrix (""he is the one...""), Avatar (the last test to become a Fremen, Paul jumps on a Worm, while Jake on a bird), The Gladiator (I don't even have to explain this .. ).. etc. 

I am a lover of original ideas and I hope that tons of money can be spend on new stories.

I don't know what other movie can top this movie aside from planet of the eighth, but other than that this was a joy to watch but to let people know that this is definitely a sequel. There are some parts that you might be confused on so if you have not watched part one, please do before going into this, now this picks up right where it left off like five minutes ago where in the first dune Paul is traveling with the Freeman alongside her mother, and they are trying to apprehend the Harkenns. Throughout this movie, you can see a transformation in Paul in the downfall of Paul at the same time he is trying to lead the Freman to Paradise, but he keeps seeing visions if he tries or even attempts to lead them to paradise the performances in this movie is really good and the first one  I thought Timothy Chalamet was kind of a little weak but in this, he has a lot to work with and it's done very well. I have not read the book so I am confused on Florence Pugh character but other than that I was in with the story just like the first one every performance is really good, especially Javier Bardem, and Austin Butler, who really steals the show this is a visual masterpiece. Every single shot is so well done keep having these change of color pallets and it don't feel like a green screen or nothing and feels like you're into this world. Zendaya was pretty cool and really fits the character. Well sometimes I'd be questioning her acting but it's OK because in this she was really good, and this is actually a deeper dive into its theme and it's theme of religion. Is religion a manipulative tool or is religion the right way to go that's how I viewed the movie on its theme. Javier Bardem and represents the manipulative tool and Zendaya is the opposite and the final battle between Austin Butler's character and Timothée Chalamet character was so intense, and to be honest, I didn't know which one to root forwork, for, i was trying to rule for Timothée Chalamet‘s character, but I realize that he is now mixed in and following the visions that he don't want to follow in Austin Butler's character was so entertaining to watch that I really want to see more of him but overall this was a fantastic movie and tell me that they're going to kill Timothée Chalamet‘s character in part three because I want to see some real good consequences since these visions are now explored and well executed and in my humble opinion, this is my movie year 9.5/10"

If not for having gone to see it with friends, I would have been perfectly fine walking out halfway, streaming it and fast forwarding to see the key moments. To me, it was not nearly as visually interesting. It was so devoid of the depth of character and relationship nuance explored in the Part 1. The complex (and possibly unhealthy) relationship between Paul and his mother that was so central in Part 1 is totally absent in Part 2. They hardly share any screen time together. Paul's ascension isn't believable, to me, nor is his change later in the movie. For me, there are other issues as well. Overall, this was hugely disappointing."

La scelta di dividere la trama per motivi di business a tratti continua a sentirsi così come era stato nella prima parte, i dialoghi sono talvolta troppo rallentati e senza particolari velleità.
L'argomento simil religioso a tratti rischia di diventare prevedibile e stopposo, in parte il problema viene rimandato a quello che sarà il prossimo capitolo.
Ottime le prove attoriali e spettacolari le sequenze finali seppure la battaglia risulta essere davvero troppo veloce rispetto alle premesse.
Nota di merito per Austin Butler, personaggio assolutamente troppo poco sviluppato."

The pacing was well kept, while the storyline was interesting and easy to follow yet intricate and in-depth.

Saw 2 yesterday in a real IMAX theater and as someone who always plays stuff loud (music or home streaming) I actually thought this one was too much.  As someone else mentioned the protagonists are great, actually all the characters are, but there are too many and the screen time they receive is uneven.  Definitely not enough Paul.

The trailers and the TV spots all seemed very convincing and I'm glad my expectations were high because this film delivered on every possible level!

First off, I should definitely mention the characters that made up the film. All of the cast did a phenomenal job, including Timothée Chalamet, and Austin Butler, who were show stealers, and I think were some of the best performances of the year. And overall the entire cast really brought the story to life and their expressions and emotions, and the way they actually made you feel connected and brought into the story that they were telling.

And the story itself across the entire film was phenomenal. I hear a lot of people say that the last film didn't have enough action in it or it was just a little too slow and not enough sequences of violence or action or whatever. And I feel like that first film does a great job of setting up this film like it's a two-part series and the first film just setting it up while the second film will do all the heavy blows and it truly does that across the film. I especially feel that seeing more of the Fremen throughout the entire film was very cool to see, especially seeing how many of them there were, their customs, and how they slowly started to trust Paul as the Lisan Al Gaib. I really enjoyed seeing Paul's arc as he slowly starts to embrace his role as Lisan Al Gaib and seeing him slowly start to turn towards a darker path in his role as the Lisan Al Gaib. The twist with House of Attreides coming from the Harkenens was really cool and interesting to see. Especially towards the end, when Paul takes the life of the Baron(his grandfather), which was incredible to witness. Even witnessing what all happens on the Harkenen home-world was incredible. Especially seeing Feyd-Rautha murder the final members (to be thought) of house Attreides was breathtaking and how ruthless and violent he truly is. Even how he messed around with Raban(portrayed by Dave Bautista) and made him seem like a little mouse to him was crazy. We truly got to see who his character and what he is as Princess Irulan(portrayed by Florence Pugh) describes him, ""He's psychotic."" Even in the final moments of the film with the phenomenal battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha, to the other houses coming to fight, the Fremen was especially how we see Chani(portrayed by Zendaya) lose Paul's trust and love. Even as we see the toll Paul's sister takes on his mother, Lady Jessica(portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson), is cool and seeing her embrace her role as a Mother. And even in the end, though the story doesn't feel complete, it seems where it comes to that conclusion we will never know what happens next. But it is confirmed that Dune Messiah is in the works. It gives you a feeling of interest and suspense as you see Paul and the Fremen prepared to take on the rest of the Houses and potentially the rest of the galaxy.

In summary, Dune 2 is a truly phenomenal film and the best film of this year. It will stun and blow everybody away from its phenomenal storytelling, to it's incredible visuals, Dune 2 is a must see film of this year, and my opinion, one of the best films of the decade. That's why Dune 2's a 10/10 film!"

❌ spoilers ❌
I was gonna wear a Anakin I don't like sand shirt but it wasn't gonna deliver until Sunday 😭. I don't love the first in my opinion it's one of the most OK films I've seen but it sets up for this juggernaut of pay off. This honestly makes me hype for what there gonna do next and this feels like the hype that we got from the what are the rings or the original Star Wars trilogy it's a real modern classic. Cinematography and set pieces blew my mind you just feel the scope the same with blowing up the helicopter things was really well done. I can't find much negatives here Austin Butler was introduced pretty late but still had a big presence and this man can do great impressions. the climax was just prefect even the small details of Paul Telly Chani that he would always love her until the day he stopped breathing then asking Princess Irulan to take his hand was such an unexpected twist, but makes sense when you stop to think about it in the bigger picture he is royalty after all, and has to do certain things for the bigger picture until he can ultimately find happiness. Perfect movie. Grade A+"

Based on the Frank Herbert series of books it stars Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Stellan Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Zendaya et al. The plot is somewhat complicated so let's just say it's the classic good vs evil, ruling empire vs the rebels, with a little Romeo and Juliet love story mixed in for fun. It's directed and co-written by Denis Villeneuve. The visuals are breathtaking, the acting is incredibly good, it features fantastic special effects with excellent fight scenes, and the script was also great. The only negative for me was the ending which was clearly just a set up for Part 3; I would have liked for the movie to end about fifteen minutes earlier but that's just me.

Visually, the film is genius with perfectly composed shots, special effects, and the colouring was epic. The use of sound was essential and the sound itself with the already epic soundtrack is not like anything I've ever heard (IMAX is LOUD. So skip it if your not good with seat-shaking level noise). The story gets more intense in part two, and requires full attention. All. The. Time. I have to say, having not read the book(s), some parts are confusing, and I lost track of what was going on at times. The casting was perfect, and I can't imagine anyone else playing any of the characters- especially Paul was perfectly cast. Every creative choice fits perfectly into the overall feel of the film- the world that it exists within, and the characters themselves.

Per quanto riguarda i pregi questo film fa esattamente ciò che un sequel dovrebbe fare, vale a dire incrementare la spettacolarità, l'azione, l'epicità e la posta in gioco. Denis Villeneuve si riconferma essere uno dei più autorevoli registi di questa generazione cinematografica, riuscendo a dare il giusto peso sia ai momenti di intimità e di quiete che ai momenti più monumentali. Ogni singolo fotogramma del film potrebbe essere esposto in una galleria non soltanto per la sua fotografia ma anche per l'impeccabilità degli effetti visivi. E' però anche vero che la regia di Villeneuve può risultare a tratti eccessivamente didascalica e accademica, senza la veracità e la visceralità che certe scene richiedono e raggiungendo degli spunti di sperimentazione in pochissimi momenti in tutto il film. Dal punto di vista narrativo il film è spaccato a metà, nella misura in cui nella prima metà si prende il giusto tempo (e forse anche troppo) a delineare la cultura del popolo dei Fremen toccando tematiche che lasciano lo spettatore con degli interessanti spunti di riflessione. Nella seconda metà però il film subisce un'accelerazione ingiustificata degli eventi e dell'evoluzione dei personaggi, con un cambio di rotta repentino subito dal protagonista che diluisce completamente il suo tumulto interiore e la tridimensionalità della sua caratterizzazione. Allo stesso tempo molti altri personaggi sono criminalmente sacrificati a favore di modifiche rispetto alla storia narrata nel libro che, oltre ad essere ingiustificate, sono state dettate contemporaneamente dalla voglia di chiudere le vicende del primo capitolo della saga letteraria e dall'impossibilità di dare il giusto spazio agli avvenimenti più importanti in un film di due ore e quarantacinque. Molte cose che erano state preannunciate nel primo capitolo non hanno la minima ripercussione in questo e allo stesso tempo viene ripetuto lo stesso identico errore, anticipando avvenimenti che verranno sviscerati chissà quando uscirà il terzo capitolo. In buona sostanza si tratta di un film che, al netto dei suoi pregi e dei suoi difetti, è alla pari del primo perché alcuni aspetti sono senz'altro migliorati ma altri che dovevano essere corretti vengono trascinati anche in questo e risultano dunque più gravi ed inaccettabili."

The rest of the flick is boring beyond words. Much like the first one, this one has ideas in it that are just mumbled through and you miss most of the dialogue. Perhaps you had to read the book beforehand to understand. OR, the issue is that there are derivative movies that were inspired by Frank Herbert's novel and mined with better execution.

I do not understand the overwhelming love of this movie. It feels so...pedestrian and mini-series milked dried. They REALLY take their time to get to a point.
Also, the drudgery of seeing a pretty dune and then...nothing.

Despite the brilliant set up from the first movie, did anyone else get the impression that the Fremen were never really in danger..? Between the giant worms, seemingly endless swathes of foot soldiers, perfectly tune to their environment, there's the inescapable feeling that the Harkonnens never really stood a chance - despite Austin Butler's incredible turn as Feed Reutha.

However, the pros here far outweigh the cons, and Dune: part 2 is going to be discussed for a very long time.

This was an experience that surpassed even the first film in its scope, characterization, attention to detail, and progression within the narrative that is masterfully and thoughtfully imagined with every frame, piece of dialogue, and a score by the legendary Hans Zimmer that truly made me feel like a kid again.  Watching films like Jurassic Park and The Matrix in a cinema around the time I became a teenager are films that easily elicited pure emotional responses that we don't often get anymore. 

The incomparable visual effects, cinematography, editing, and brilliant adapted screenplay are just a few more of the accolades this film deserves.  The ensemble cast, from Chalamet to Butler to Chanti to Ferguson to Bardem to Skarsgård to Pugh - Denis brings out their absolute best and it is undeniably apparent everyone from cast and crew are eternally invested.

I don't anticipate another film in 2024 that is going to surpass what Villeneuve has achieved and despite a March release, I would hope this is a film that is recognized and appreciated at the end of the year; especially when awards season is in full force.

All I can say, unequivocally, is Dune Part II...was worth the wait (and Stilgar believes)."

There were some changes to the story that I have a rough time accepting, particularly the ENTIRE re-write of Chani is not what I would have done.  Why do I give 5 stars?  Because the amazing content that Denis and the crew and actors provided is just so fantastic, and it's impossible to do a Dune movie so hey, very well done guys, I appreciate the insanely hard work and talent.

My favorite interpretations so far have been Feyd, big time, Stilgar, Peter DeVries, and the entire treatment of the Sardaukar.  The worm riding, fascinating, I never thought about doing it that way, I get it, just hadn't thought about the worm just staying far enough out of the sand to keep the exposed segments out.

"","Christian M","","Mar 27, 2024","This movie delivered on stunning visuals and seat-shaking action, but still suffered from poor casting of the main protagonists, spotty storytelling, and sequences or features that made little sense.  Part of effective an sci-fi movie experience is the suspension of disbelief, where something may not be possible or likely in the ""real world"", it is supported within the ""imaginary"" world that is created.  In the case of the Dune remake, it's simply distracting.  As a fan of the original movie, I had high hopes for this remake using modern technology, but left with a ""decent, but not great"" impression."

When I watched the first part some time ago, I wasn't very impressed. The film was very slow and the excitement didn't start until the last 15 minutes. This film, on the other hand, was thrilling from start to finish. There were many memorable moments and the excitement was tense most of the time. The fact that time flew like a bird while watching this film was a special expression that there was no lack of excitement.

Also, I can't say that the film was too abrupt. There was love, depression and compassion very cleverly woven in. The film offered the whole spectrum of emotions.

Speaking of the actors, Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides did an excellent job, offering both character development and the inner dilemmas of gaining power. One could get quite a deep understanding of the phrase 'power corrupts'. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha was also excellent. The inner psychological instability reflected in him was extremely convincing.

Visually, the film was extremely well made. Combined with the music by Hanz Zimmer, the visuals were so evocative that in some moments I found myself shivering. Definitely a film to experience in the cinema. Excellent."

Superior to its prequel, if only because most of the best stuff was reserved for this second outing, the story is now familiar to any who have seen Avatar: the outsider will become the aboriginal, and then lead them to glory. That Avatar was much inspired by the story of Dune doesn't really change the fact that the blue-skinned ones somehow did it better. Dune is a much more serious affair, of course, but its espouses true depth of character for its epic story and visuals. We never really get close to anyone - they are all pieces to serve the story. The love story is fine if predictable. I still don't know how the sandworms move, or why they don't submerge and throw off their riders, or what they eat - but the rule of cool dominates here. We have a much more dangerous villain in the young Harkonnen prince, and the movie takes the time to convince us he is worthy before he goes up against Paul Atriedes. But, villains be damned, for the story really hinges around Paul fulfilling or not fulfilling his destiny, both of which have serious consequences. I didn't really understand why, in the end, he had to do what he did, but he seems blessed with Dr.Strangeseque Endgame foretelling, so apparently this was the only choice. Hmmm. What IS great, is the last Act, which I won't spoil here, but which takes a twist away from novel and the older movie version, a twist for the better I would say. And the music... Zimmer really pulled out all the stops this time, with a soaringly tragic love theme which is just sublime. For all its shallow thrills, I greatly enjoyed Dune 2, and if it feels familiar it is really because Dune has inspired so many other stories in turn, so credit where credit is due. What will be fascinating is seeing where they go next, for the sequel novels were trippy to the point of incoherence often. Let's hope the movies, as they seem to be, truly chart their own course ahead. Dune doesn't rival Star Wars or Star Trek... yet. But it may..."

The other thing Villeneuve's Dune movies lack is any sense of who lives in Arrakeen, a city without citizens.

El cómo la película plantea la postura del elegido en Paul y Feyd-Rautha me pareció increíble, continuando con la visión del ""falso elegido"" que la primera película había explorado, pero ahora visto desde dos diferentes posturas, pero guiadas por el mismo resultado, ""ser una solución ante el planto poco visible de ambos planetas"". Una solución que vemos paralelamente con la historia principal, manipulada por externos que únicamente buscan el poder, creando la duda en el espectador si realmente nuestro protagonista es el elegido o solo es una profecía que todos necesitan que se cumpla, siendo testigos del cómo verdadera o falsamente, Paul adoptó esa personalidad, que cada vez parece que se hacera a repetir los errores ególatras de los extintos Atreides. Una dirección impecable, tanto en crear tensión en escenas expositivas como en escenas de acción con una sobriedad espectacular, una fotografía que adopta los mundos extravagantes de películas europeas de finales de los 50's pero con un toque contemporáneo fantástico, posiblemente los mejores actores de su generación congeniando en una película que reluce que tienen todo el potencial para ser la nueva cara de Hollywood, una banda sonora memorable y envolvente del genio Hans Zimmer. En síntesis, una película que sobre para todos los medios técnicos para hacerse llamar obra maestra."

While accepting his nature as a new Messiah, he must face a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.

The movie is a spectacular experience in the big screen, IMAX preferably, with the stunning and cinematography and impressive visual effects. The costume design and the production design outdid themselves with this second installment. And the sound and Hans Zimmer's score continue to amaze viewers with its epicness. The 2025 Oscars will definitely have Dune Part Two among the biggest contenders of the ceremony. Also, the whole cast gives its best, especially Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler and Rebecca Ferguson. Even Javier Bardem's Stilgar that gives the movie some of the best comic relief moments of the movie. Ultimately, so epic and captivating that I want to read the first book right now!"

The field battle with Feyd-Rautha (played by a pale skinned/albino-ized variant of Austin Butler) was almost entirely devoid of color, making the most uncanny feeling of fear.

For those who care about the book, whether you like this movie or not will hinge on how you feel about the adaptation's changes to Chani. They took a lot of editorial liberty with her character. In some ways, it makes the adaptation feel like the book was adapted to modern sensibilities, but also, it makes me a little sad to see the book not adapted as faithfully as it could have been.

It's an excellent movie, it's just not a perfect adaptation of Dune, whether that bothers you is up to you."

The first 1.5 hours basically could have been summarized before the actual movie started, in a small scrolling paragraph shorter than a star wars intro. It was painfully long. The most recent Avatar was about the same length,but it didn't feel like it to me. This FELT like 3 hours. 

The 2nd half was good and fun. 

Zendaya is a good actress, but looking at her scowling face got old. Christopher Walken seemed to not care he was there, and also just seemed out of place in this universe. 

My biggest gripe is that the original Dune movie from the 80s, was just one film, and covered more ground/lore than both of these dune movies did at triple the run time.

Austin Butler was the biggest surprise."

Standing on its own, I asbolutely loved this movie. It looks great. The character arcs are nicely done. It has a bit of a problem with pacing at times and the Feyd Rautha bits feel a bit off. But all in all it's one of the better movies that I've seen recently.

But it's based on a book, so it's not unfair to compare it to the source material.
And there it falls a bit short. It can't be avoided that a book like Dune gets simplified when brought to the big screen. But from the richness of themes in the Dune novel, Villeneuve seems to have picked only two: ""the danger of charismatic leaders"" and ""Paul's struggle against becoming a messianic figure"". And he REALLY wanted to make sure that the audience got it. Which leaves out a lot of the other themes and scenes from the book.

The biggest changes are of course his relationship with Chani and how he basically just gives in to the holy war that will be fought in his name. The fact that this surrender to his ""destiny"" happens rather fast makes it a bit jarring.

Good movie. Good acting. Very impressive visual effects. As an adaptation of the book it falls a bit short."

The beautiful cinematography keeps it 100% just like the first movie, despite it being set in mostly desert territory. Every character is perfectly executed, written beautifully, and I'd say Zendaya, Bardem, Chalamet, and Butler were the beating heart of this film. Paired together with one of Hans Zimmer's best scores, a gorgeously sinister overlook into the future (hint hint, Dune: Messiah); this is the makings of perfect storytelling, paired with some of the best action and fight scenes put to the screen.

"","Joshua","","Mar 25, 2024","I'd say the story was old and stale but the books are 40 years old so perhaps that explains the same story I've seen before. Yet another movie that didn't need to be 3 hours +. Seen it all before. Fight sequences are so up close like always. Fast cuts. No real feel of the battle. Special effects are good, but I do that for a living and once again seen it all before. Actors are good, but young. Love senerio is contrive, and prophecy is weak."

Allow me to explain…

The characters, the visuals, the storytelling, the dialogue, the action, the music, the sound design, everything about this movie was CINEMA PERFECTION! 

It truly is one of the best sequels of all time and Timothee Chalamet knows how to lead a movie. Zendaya stole the show. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler, and Dave Bautista were sooo GOOD as well!! 

When I tell you I had tears in my eyes, I did. Not because the movie was sad, but because it was beautiful. If you're a movie buff like me, or you love sci-fi in general, please watch this movie.

Sloppy!) The ending...Paul leads the fighters off to fight the other houses in battle in space, Chiani leaves for the South to lead her people, and we walk out without any true conclusion to a story.

"","Jeffrey K.","","Mar 24, 2024","Dune: Part Two not only successfully carries on the many great things about Part One, but also elevates them considerably. The world building alone continues to be so out of this world. Patrice Vermettes production design absolutely deserves a lot of the credit for that. The makeup work as well as Jacqueline Wests costumes are even more imaginative this time around. Greig Frasers cinematography here officially solidifies him as one of the best directors of photography working today. As I was watching the many visual effects sequences, I kept wondering how the hell did they pull that off?!. Having caught this in IMAX, the sound work and Hans Zimmers score both shined through all the speakers surrounding me.

The performances are also more enriching in this installment. Timothe Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson both continue such strong work here as Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica, respectively. Meanwhile, those who had less to do in the first film have a lot more to do here. Zendaya as Chani, Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, and Javier Bardem as Stilgar are each in great form. Not only that, but I thought Zendaya also shared some great onscreen chemistry with Chalamet. As for the new cast members, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (in a move 10 times more interesting than his overrated performance in Elvis), Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, and even Christopher Walken as her father, Shaddam IV, all make for great additions.

Most of all, the story is so emotionally engaging from start to finish. Not only that, but it also kind of feels relevant to whats currently going on in the world. The film itself may be a bit of a slow burn, but Joe Walkers editing thankfully keeps the whole thing well paced. Theres definitely a lot to unpack here, but thats what subsequent rewatches should be there for. In any case, Dune: Part Two absolutely deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Its EPIC in every conceivable way imaginable!"

Not my favorite book in my taste, but at least it was real creativity, you learned to care for the protagonists.  This movie , Dune 2, does not explain anything of what is at stake here and why,  Only Zendaya stands out in what is otherwise a boring, noisy and way too long movie."

It improves on pretty much everything that was a bit rough with part one mainly the pacing is perfect. It balances being slow with big payoffs of incredible action that is filled with massive scale and scope. The special effects are excellent and even though the CGI is noticeable it's always used in original and epic ways. The camerawork is top notch and you always feel fully immersed in the world. This looks and feels truly epic. Austin Butler steals the show in the acting dept and that's saying a lot because everyone is giving A grade performances across the board here. Tim & Zendaya are good together but the chemistry could've been a bit better perhaps. Really the only slight issue is while editing is really good overall, it feels chunky at times. This has tons of ideas and goes very slow to fit it all and never feel bloated. Sometimes it can be a little hard to follow every particular plot point but the direction is so strong your able to get the general idea. Compared to the 84' one this improves so much it's not even comparable. The romance is perfectly interwoven, explored, developed and fleshed out, and feels earned rather than hammed in. It allows you to digest ideas much better and Stellan as the villian is way better here and not cartooony like the other one. The acting here balances being serious but never emotionless perfectly as well compared to Lynch's. Everyone should give this a try once. Dune 1 can be a bit slow to get through but the payoff is worth it to watch this. All Time Classic."

I also believe the original story is so complex that the fans are thrilled anyone made it into a decent movie. Maybe also the fact someone finaly brought back some seriousness into big budget sci-fi (khm Marvel). Casting is poorly done. The main characters simply can't pull it off. On the other hand the giants of acting that stand besides them haven't been given enough to work with. First thing that comes to mind is Edward Furlong in T2. That kid, that young, and inexperienced pulled off way harder task than Timothy. There's simply not enough oomph to him. Zendaya was just a vehicle, and a pretty face to drive to the final plot twist, rather than a desert warrior on a distant, savage planet. I give it a decent rating, as i hope it will become a beacon of light to lead the Hollywood future. I believe lots of critics do it for the same reason."

This gigantic visual spectacle features some characters you know from the first film and some interesting new ones, including Christopher Walken. It is visually stunning, dark, complex, and draws from great cinema and deep historical references of the past of human history. We saw it in IMAX which is well worth it. This film is definitely want to see in the theater and you should not wait to watch on a television. You will only get about half the effect on a TV screen. That said, the film was a bit long, and despite a few slow moments, it kept us fully engaged, and felt and thrallingly real, despite its other-worldly characters and planets. Truly, an inspiring piece of cinema, the captures, both the human spirit, the conflict of humanity, the flaws of emotion, and the goodness of the human spirit. Great cinema!"

This film looks just as good, if not better than the 2021 original, and this films writing and direction is just so much better than the previous film. That isn't a knock on the previous film though, as I thought they did a great job in the same departments there, but in this film it was just so good that I'd be lying if I said they were equal. I even had to go back and change my score for the previous Dune film after watching this one, as this was so much better in almost every conceivable way. This film truly used its 166 minute runtime to the fullest, as there wasn't a single scene in this film that I didn't find necessary or compelling, which left this film feeling a lot shorter than it really is. Hans Zimmer's score also elevates this film to new heights, as it fits so well with the film, but I think it's a captivating score to listen to even outside of watching the movie. With all of its amazing landscapes, and beautiful effects, this film begs to be watched in a theatre. This film also does greatly at expanding the world and characters of Dune, by adding depth, and introducing new elements, which makes it all the more interesting to watch. Paul has such a great arc and a ton of character growth throughout this film. Overall, Dune: Part Two is a fantastic follow-up to the 2021 film, and is easily the best new film I've seen this year so far, and realistically, it may not be topped, though we we are still early into the year so anything could happen. Go see this on the big screen. You will not regret it."
